## Getting Started

## User Types and Workflow

### User Roles and Permissions

The Financial Management System is designed to serve different types of users with carefully defined access levels:

#### 1. Admin Users
- **Full System Access**
- Can perform all actions across the platform
- Responsibilities:
  - Create and manage client profiles
  - Add and manage user accounts
  - Perform system-wide configurations
  - Delete client records
  - Generate comprehensive reports

#### 2. Finance Team Users
- **Transactional and Financial Management**
- Core financial operations specialists
- Permissions:
  - Create, view, update, and delete financial transactions
  - Generate and manage invoices
  - Process payments
  - Conduct financial reporting
  - Search and filter financial data

#### 3. Auditor Users
- **Compliance and Oversight**
- Read-only access for financial monitoring
- Capabilities:
  - View all financial transactions
  - Review invoices
  - Generate financial reports
  - Verify financial records
  - Cannot modify or delete records

#### 4. Client Users
- **Self-Service and Limited Access**
- View and manage their own financial information
- Permissions:
  - View their own transactions
  - Access their invoices
  - Generate personal financial reports
  - Cannot modify system-wide data

### Typical Workflow Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: New Client Onboarding
1. Admin creates a new client profile
2. System automatically generates a client user account
3. Client receives login credentials
4. Client can now view their financial information

#### Scenario 2: Financial Transaction Processing
1. Finance user logs a new transaction for a client
2. Transaction is recorded with timestamp and details
3. System automatically updates client financial records
4. Auditors can review the transaction
5. Client can view the transaction in their history

#### Scenario 3: Invoice Management
1. Finance user generates an invoice for a client
2. Invoice is created with due date and amount
3. System tracks payment status (Pending, Partially Paid, Paid)
4. Automatic status updates based on payment received
5. Client notified of invoice details
6. Overdue invoices flagged for follow-up

#### Scenario 4: Financial Reporting
1. Admin or Finance user generates a financial report
2. Report includes:
   - Transaction history
   - Invoice details
   - Payment status
   - Comprehensive financial overview
3. Report can be downloaded as PDF
4. Auditors can review report for compliance

### Resource-Level Permissions

The system defines granular actions for each primary resource:

| Resource             | Admin         | Finance       | Auditor       | Client        |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Clients             | CRUD          | CRU           | Read          | Read (Own)    |
| Users               | CRUD          | -             | -             | -             |
| Financial Transactions | CRUD      | CRUD          | Read          | Read (Own)    |
| Audit Logs          | CRUD          | -             | Read          | -             |
| Invoices            | CRUD          | CRUD          | Read          | Read (Own)    |

**Notation Legend:**
- **CRUD**: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- **CRU**: Create, Read, Update
- **Read**: View-only access
- **Read (Own)**: Access limited to user's own records
- **-**: No access
